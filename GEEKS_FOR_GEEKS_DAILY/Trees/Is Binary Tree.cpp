/*
You are given a binary tree, and the task is to determine whether it satisfies the properties of a max-heap.

A binary tree is considered a max-heap if it satisfies the following conditions:

Completeness: Every level of the tree, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
Max-Heap Property: The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
